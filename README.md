The Smart Bus Route Optimizer System is an innovative application designed to streamline urban transportation by providing commuters with the most efficient bus routes. Built on graph-based algorithms and adjacency list modeling, the system calculates optimal paths between bus stops while allowing users to prioritize shortest distance, minimum stops, or fastest travel time. Its backend ensures robust optimization and error-free computation, while the frontend offers an interactive, visually engaging interface with clear route maps and playful design elements. By combining technical rigor with user-friendly visualization, the system enhances accessibility, reduces travel complexity, and lays the foundation for future integration with real-time traffic data and multi-modal transport options.
